# DataPilot
This project proposes the development of a Data Engineer Agent that automates data ingestion pipelines using StateFlow to translate business-level requests into SQL queries, generating actionable insights using Large Language Models (LLMs). Leveraging datasets like the Spider text-to-SQL dataset and sample business intelligence databases (e.g., AdventureWorks, Northwind), the agent will streamline query generation and reporting. Additionally, it may assist DevOps teams by generating incident response playbooks based on observability alerts and codebase knowledge, extending capabilities into monitoring and response automation.
