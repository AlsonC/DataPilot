# üöÄ Data Engineer Agent for Observability Tasks

## Overview
Welcome to the **Data Engineer Agent Project**! This project aims to automate data ingestion pipelines and streamline Business Intelligence (BI) reporting using **StateFlow** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. We're also exploring automation for DevOps teams by generating real-time incident response playbooks based on observability alerts and codebase knowledge. All powered by advanced AI, this agent will reduce manual intervention and boost system efficiency.

### Key Features
- **Automated Data Pipelines**: No more manual data ingestion! We'll automate data workflows with tools like **Apache NiFi** and **Airflow**.
- **SQL Query Generation**: Translate business-level requests into **SQL queries** using **LLMs** and datasets like **Spider**.
- **Business Intelligence Insights**: Effortlessly generate BI reports using real-time data.
- **Incident Response Automation**: DevOps teams get instant playbooks based on live system behavior and code knowledge.
- **Enterprise-Grade Robustness**: Scaling for multi-cloud environments while ensuring **trustworthiness** and **accuracy** in complex data ecosystems.

### Why This Matters
Managing data pipelines and handling BI requests can be time-consuming. With our Data Engineer Agent, we aim to achieve:
- üìä **Instant BI Reports**: LLMs do the heavy lifting to provide quick, actionable insights.
- ü§ñ **Automated Playbooks**: Real-time response playbooks for DevOps, generated on-the-fly based on system alerts.
- üîç **Less Manual Work**: Automated workflows mean you focus on strategy, not maintenance.
  
### Research Focus
1. **Automating Data Pipelines**: Ensuring seamless data ingestion and management.
2. **Streamlining BI Reporting**: Transforming natural language requests into SQL queries.
3. **Incident Response Automation**: Generating playbooks from real-time observability data.
4. **Tackling LLM Limitations**: Mitigating hallucinations and ensuring data trustworthiness.
5. **Enterprise Integration**: Scaling across multi-cloud and complex data environments.

### Tech Stack
- **LLMs**: Powering natural language to SQL transformations.
- **StateFlow**: Managing complex workflows.
- **Work In Progress**: Project is under construction, this section will be updated accordingly :D

### üß† Built On Top of Prior Work
We leverage advanced models like **SQLNet**, **Codex**, and frameworks like **Spider** to handle natural language-to-SQL translations, improving upon their limitations to manage **complex queries** and **dynamic schemas**. In DevOps, we‚Äôre taking observability tools like **Prometheus** to the next level with automated response actions.
